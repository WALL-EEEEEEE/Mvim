# Mvim

**Mvim** is a composition of vim and some vim plugins, which I used it as my  daily development personally.  
&ensp;&ensp;It's sufficient for me to write `Java` , `PHP`, `C/C++` , `Python` , `Go` , `Javascript`.And you can also tweak it to match 
your personal development requirements after `git clone` it

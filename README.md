# Mvim

**Mvim** is a composition of vim and some vim plugins, which I used it as my  daily development personally.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It's sufficient for me to write some `Java` , `PHP`, `C/C++` , `Python` , `Go` , `Javascript`. And you can feel free to tweak it to match 
your personal development requirements after `git clone` it.
